        <h1>Me and coding</h1>
        <p>
            In 2019, I spent more time at home due to COVID-19.<br />
            And then I became interested in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first started with C language. Then I tried Java, C#, Python, and more.<br />
            Now I code with javascript/typescript.
